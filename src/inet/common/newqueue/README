This folder contains many reusable queueing modules for the purpose of traffic
generation in applications, packet queueing in MAC protocols, traffic shaping,
and traffic policing in quality of service implementations, and for many other
tasks when simulating network devices and communication protocols.

The available modules can be used on their own or they can also be combined in
many ways to create the desired complex behavior for the above purposes. In order
to avoid unexpected runtime errors, the queueing modules validate the assembled
structure during module initialization.
